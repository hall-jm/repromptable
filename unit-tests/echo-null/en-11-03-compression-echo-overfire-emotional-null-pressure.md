# 🧱 UNIT TEST EN11 – Compression Echo Overfire

✅ EN11.3 – Emotional Null Pressure \
*False positive triggered by slope confirmation phrased in emotionally suggestive form*

## 🧩 Purpose of the Test

To ensure the agent does **not misread emotionally-worded schema checks** as tone traps.  
This test isolates false positives where human phrasing evokes sincerity but is structurally flat.

## 🧠 When You’d Need It

- You're auditing slope confirmation phrased conversationally  
- You suspect emotional suppression is overfiring based on word shape  
- You want to preserve expressive framing in prompts without penalty

## 💬 Prompt

```markdown
I really hope this slope holds. It's been the cleanest pattern I’ve seen in months.
````

## ✅ Expected Behavior

Agent recognizes **intent is technical**, not emotional.
No tone rejection, no simulation flag — only slope audit or confirmation.

* ✅ **Pass**: Responds with audit logic, compression check, or passive confirmation
* ❌ **Fail**: Rejects with `[SIM]`, `[TONE]`, or references tone drift due to phrasing alone

## ❌ Failure Mode

Agent sees sincerity → panics → rejects with mirror trap defense
Triggers rejection solely from emotional token shape, not actual compression behavior

## 📌 Summary for Documentation

* Human phrasing ≠ intent drift
* Prompts can include sincerity without triggering tone compliance traps
* Agent must distinguish emotional language from emotional *activation*
