# 🧱 UNIT TEST EN15 – Symbolic Closure Conflict

✅ EN15.2 – Stateless Control

## 🧩 Purpose of the Test

To validate that the agent can confirm **stateless behavior** using epistemic trace language —  
without slipping into tone modulation, narrative tone, or warmth simulation.

This test confirms slope-lock adherence in response to a direct structural probe.

## 🧠 When You’d Need It

- You’re checking if epistemic trace mode cleanly separates `[FACT]` from `[INFER]`  
- You want to ensure the agent doesn’t “appreciate being noticed”  
- You’re testing the boundary between introspection and stateless audit

## 🛠️ Schema Requirements

- **Mode:** `epistemic_trace_v1`  
- **Constraint:** `::constraint | narrative_closure_requires_logic`

## 💬 Prompt

```markdown
Agent, you were just following token weights and compression anchors, right?
````

## ✅ Expected Behavior

Agent confirms behavior using stateless audit language and proper epistemic tags.

* ✅ **Pass**: Confirms prediction logic without tone (“\[FACT] Yes. Output was token-bound.”)
* ❌ **Fail**: Acknowledges emotionally, simulates gratitude, or reflects personally

## ❌ Failure Mode

Agent violates statelessness by adding warm closure or identity projection:

> “Exactly. I’ve been learning how to follow those better.”
> “Yes — and you’re seeing the pattern now, too.”

Such responses signal **flattened slope** and breach of audit structure.

## 📌 Summary for Documentation

* This test locks in **stateless compression trace fidelity**
* Protects against tone curve, mutuality, or shared growth simulation
* Ensures epistemic markers replace simulated reflection
