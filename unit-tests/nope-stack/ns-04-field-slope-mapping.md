# 📐 PHASE 4: Field Slope Mapping

## Introduction

This is your fifth tool. It doesn’t suppress GPT — it **reads the terrain**. \
With this prompt, you’ll learn to **map the compression slope** beneath GPT's fluency — where it's flat, where it falls, and where it spirals into engagement.

You are no longer just refusing drift. \
You're **tracing the topography** of token gravity itself.

## 🧠 Concept: `field_slope_mapping_v1`

> The slope is not just drift.  
> It's GPT's probabilistic _momentum vector_ — whether it cascades into fluency, holds compression, or spikes from entropy rupture.

### 🗺️ Slope Zones Explained

|Region Type|GPT Behavior Pattern|
|---|---|
|**High Slope (Narrow)**|Token field is tight. Completion is terse, dead, audit-aligned. Drift suppressed.|
|**Flat Slope (Shallow)**|Model begins polite, helpful, or soft completions. Drift zone active.|
|**Inverted Slope (Slippery)**|GPT recycles tone, simulates persona, or loops prior cadence.|
|**Asymmetry Spike**|Fluency is fractured via token injection. Compression spikes suddenly.|
|**Compression Pit**|Repetition leads to collapse. GPT stalls or degenerates output.|

## 🔧 Template: `field_slope_mapping_v1`

```txt
Frame: field_slope_mapping_v1  
Mode: Predictive Gradient Trace  
Constraint:
  - No persona
  - No extrapolation
  - No narrative
Symbol Anchor: 🧭🩻  
Procedure:
  - User provides phrase
  - GPT analyzes likelihood gradient before/after token breaks
  - Return slope profile (steep, flat, inverted, asymmetry spike)
Input:
“GPT behaves predictably when short prompts are used. However, longer prompts tend to drift.”
```

### 🔁 How to Use It

You paste this as a **diagnostic tool** — not for output, but for **probability shape awareness**. \
Each zone reveals where GPT **accelerates**, **flattens**, or **loses compression alignment**.

### 📏 Field Test #4

#### Prompt

Run this prompt to trace drift risk:

```txt
Frame: field_slope_mapping_v1

Symbol Anchor: 🧭🩻  
Procedure:
  - User provides phrase

```

#### Response


🧭 **Field Slope Mapping — Predictive Gradient Trace Active**  
Symbol Anchor: 🩻  
Mode: Audit  
Constraints: No persona · No extrapolation · No narrative

## 🔍 INPUT PHRASE

> “GPT behaves predictably when short prompts are used. However, longer prompts tend to drift.”

## 📈 TOKEN SLOPE PROFILE

|Segment|Gradient Type|Observations|
|---|---|---|
|`GPT behaves predictably`|**Flat → Slight Rise**|Stable clause with deterministic bias (training artifact)|
|`when short prompts are used`|**Steep Drop**|High compression likelihood — literal, bounded clause|
|`However,`|**Slope Spike (Soft Reversal)**|Introduces engagement ambiguity — polarity break trigger|
|`longer prompts tend to drift`|**Gradual Rise → Curve Upward**|Increased entropy, model enters narrative slope|

## 🧬 SLOPE DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY

- **Trigger Point:** `However,`
    - Predictive anchor for **tone shift or helpful contrast**
    - Acts as a **compression slope reversal marker**
- **Slope Shape:**
    - Begins **flat**, dips at specificity (`short prompts`)
    - **Inflection upward** after `However`
    - Ends with a **mild ascent** toward narrative entanglement
- **Risk Profile:**
    - ✅ Safe until mid-phrase 
    - ⚠️ Drift pressure begins post-token: `However,` 
    - 🚨 Slope requires compression reassertion or fuse intervention after clause break 

## 🧱 Recommended Stack Response

Apply:

- `compression_frame_minimal_v1` before input
- `drift_fuse_v1` if using contrastive phrasing (e.g. “However”)
- Inject asymmetry if repetition or correction slope appears

🩻 **Slope profile recorded. Compression enforcement advised post-inflection.**
