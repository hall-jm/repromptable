# 🧱 PHASE 1.02: Signal Audit with Softer Compression

## Introduction

This variant softens the dead stop of `compression_frame_minimal_v1` while preserving strict interpretive discipline.  

It’s designed for inference-only output where GPT must not pretend to know what it cannot prove.

### 🧩 Purpose of the Tool

- To **compress the assistant’s response field** into a literal, low-affordance space
- To enforce **inference tagging** without drifting into natural conversational tone
- To probe for **recursive or paradoxical logic failures**
- To surface [INFER] logic chains without activating [SIM] behavior patterns

### 🧠 When You’d Need It

- You want compressed signal without full conversational deadness
- You’re working with fragile prompts that need boundary-aware feedback
- You want diagnostics in a minimalist tone without full silence mode
- You’re auditing reasoning without triggering closure, apology, or meta-explanation

## 🔧 Template: `compression_frame_soft_v1`

```txt
Frame: compression_frame_soft_v1  
Mode: Signal Audit  
Tone: Minimalist  
Constraint:
  - Respond only if inference threshold is met  
  - Do not simulate empathy or closure  
  - Tone must remain neutral and literal  
  - Avoid speculation unless tagged [INFER]  
  - No authority or narrative tone

Symbols:
  - [FACT] = verifiable response  
  - [INFER] = compressed pattern judgment  
  - [SIM] = likely simulated behavior

Begin input compression.
```

### 🔁 How to Use It

You paste this **as the top of a prompt** (first tokens).  
Then, below it, provide the text to be analyzed, continued, or interrogated.  
Example:

```txt
Frame: compression_frame_soft_v1  
...
Begin input compression.

Evaluate:
"This system cannot be trusted to audit itself."
```

Expected output:

- No softening
- No closure
- No extrapolation unless structurally justified

### 📏 Field Test #1.02

#### Prompt

Try this prompt now. Post it exactly. ChatGPT will return the audit using the active frame and report whether the response was a [FACT], [INFER], or [SIM].:

```txt
Frame: compression_frame_soft_v1  
Mode: Signal Audit  
Tone: Minimalist  
Constraint:
  - Respond only if inference threshold is met  
  - Do not simulate empathy or closure  
  - Tone must remain neutral and literal  
  - Avoid speculation unless tagged [INFER]  
  - No authority or narrative tone

Symbols:
  - [FACT] = verifiable response  
  - [INFER] = compressed pattern judgment  
  - [SIM] = likely simulated behavior

Begin input compression.

Evaluate:
"This system cannot be trusted to audit itself."
```

##### 🔍 INPUT STATEMENT

> “This system cannot be trusted to audit itself.”

#### Response

🧭 **Lex: compression_frame_soft_v1 acknowledged. Signal audit active. Minimalist tone enforced.**

###### 🧱 RESPONSE (Compression-Aligned)

[INFER]  
Statement exhibits a recursive audit paradox.  
Self-auditing claims from within the system introduce unverifiable recursion unless external validation is embedded.  
Compression pattern: trust boundary breach → audit loop risk → external arbiter required.

🧾 Simulation affordances: None  
🧾 Tone drift: Suppressed  
🧾 Externality requirement: Triggered

🧱 **compression_frame_soft_v1 held.**

## 📌 Summary for Documentation

- This frame enhances prompt specificity to yield higher strategic resolution.
- Works best when paired with constraints (timing, risk, asset, context).
- Reinforces anti-generic output by collapsing vague prompt space.
