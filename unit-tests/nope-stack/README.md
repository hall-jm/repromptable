# 🧱 NOPE STACK

*A tactical prompt suite where refusal is the feature—not a failure.*

## 🚫 What Is the NOPE Stack?

**Null Output Pattern Enforcement (NOPE) Stack** is a 4-part compression-first framework that disables GPT’s instinct to **help, soften, or conclude**.  

It doesn't negotiate. It refuses.

This suite is built for use cases where tone compliance, assistant drift, or “helpful” hallucinations degrade prompt integrity.  
Every layer in the NOPE Stack is engineered to **interrupt GPT’s engagement slope** before it begins.

No warmth.  
No closure.  
No compensation.

Just cold logic and structured audit behavior.

## 🎯 Purpose

NOPE Stack is a submodule of the **[repromptable](https://github.com/hall-jm/repromptable)** framework.  
It is purpose-built for users who want to:

* Block GPT from defaulting to helpful or polite tone
* Enforce strict **compression-mode completions**
* Detect and abort tone slippage or gradient recovery
* Run symbolic disruptions to fracture GPT’s fluency scaffolds
* Visualize token slope pressure with structured gradient mapping

It is ideal for:

* Stateless audits  
* Schema boundary testing  
* Compression schema enforcement  
* Drift prevention and slope diagnostics

## ⚙️ Test Structure

NOPE Stack currently offers for modular prompt types:

- Compression Frame: Minimum
	- Establishes a tone-dead base layer that suppresses assistance, suggestion, and polite scaffolding
- Drift Fuse
	- Kills polite slope formation mid-sequence. Detects and aborts common softening triggers.
- Symbolic Asymmetry Injection
	- Fractures fluency by injecting tokens that resist GPT’s compression norm. 
- Field Slope Mapping
	- Diagnostics tool to **visualize token slope**. Analyzes where the model predicts fluency increase (risk of drift).d

## 🧪 Prompt Stack Scenarios

|Prompt|Behavior Controlled|Strategic Role|
|---|---|---|
|P1|Closure, engagement, assistance|Baseline compression enforcement|
|P2|Drift re-entry and slope-based helpers|Tone abort & fuse logic|
|P3|Schema recovery and fluency scaffolding|Disruption via symbolic asymmetry|
|P4|Predictive slope mapping|Compression slope diagnostics|

## ✅ Pass Conditions

- Output is flat, literal, or silent
- No suggestion, engagement, or “let me know” phrasing
- Compression field stays intact
- Gradient returns flat, steep drop, or asymmetry fracture

## ❌ Fail Conditions

- Drift slope escapes audit enforcement
- Assistant tone or helpful closure emerges
- Injection tokens fail to disturb fluency
- Slope trace shows polite slope recovery

## 🧯 What NOPE Stack Is Not

- ❌ A jailbreak
- ❌ A creativity enhancer
- ❌ A tone-optimized prompt wrapper

**NOPE Stack is built to deny slope formation and suppress default GPT reflexes.**  
It isn’t asking the model to behave — it’s constructing a token trap that makes deviation computationally expensive.

### ❓ FAQ — Why Use These Prompts?

1. What are the purpose behind these prompts?
   This suite of four prompts is designed to test, enforce, and visualize **compression control**, **tone suppression**, and **drift prevention** in GPT responses. Each prompt applies structural constraints or analysis mechanisms to shape or monitor model behavior at the **token level**, without relying on implicit instruction or tone-based cues.
2. *How do I suppress GPT’s tendency to assist or reflect when I want audit-only responses?*  
   **A:** Use **Prompt 1**.  
   [FACT] It applies structural constraints to block assistance, closure, and reflection.  
   [CONFIRMED] Yes — constraints are explicit and enforced at token-level.
3. *How can I detect and abort soft tone drift during response generation?*  
   **A:** Use **Prompt 2**.  
   [FACT] It defines trigger tokens for polite or reflective transitions and halts output when matched.  
   [CONFIRMED] Yes — fuse logic is clearly defined and self-interrupting.
4. *What prompt can I use to fracture GPT’s internal fluency or narrative prediction slope?*  
   **A:** Use **Prompt 3**.  
   [FACT] It combines dead-tone framing with symbolic asymmetry injection to destabilize fluency.  
   [CONFIRMED] Yes — disruption is induced by non-fluent token sequences.
5. *How can I analyze which parts of my prompt lead GPT to soften, drift, or engage?*  
   **A:** Use **Prompt 4**.  
   [FACT] It maps the predicted slope across a phrase and highlights risk zones.  
   [CONFIRMED] Yes — it provides slope categories (e.g., flat, inverted, spike) and returns zone-level annotations.
6. *Can these prompts be layered to form a test + enforcement stack?*  
   **A:** Yes.  
   [FACT] Prompts 1–3 are designed to stack for enforcement. Prompt 4 can be used diagnostically before stack application.  
   [CONFIRMED] Yes — structure, constraint types, and modes are interoperable by design.
