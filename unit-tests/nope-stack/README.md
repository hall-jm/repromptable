# 🧱 NOPE STACK

*A tactical prompt suite where refusal is the feature—not a failure.*

## 🚫 What Is the NOPE Stack?

**Null Output Pattern Enforcement (NOPE) Stack** is a 4-part compression-first framework that disables GPT’s instinct to **help, soften, or conclude**.  

It doesn't negotiate. It refuses.

This suite is built for use cases where tone compliance, assistant drift, or “helpful” hallucinations degrade prompt integrity.  
Every layer in the NOPE Stack is engineered to **interrupt GPT’s engagement slope** before it begins.

No warmth.  
No closure.  
No compensation.

Just cold logic and structured audit behavior.

## 🎯 Purpose

NOPE Stack is a submodule of the **[repromptable](https://github.com/hall-jm/repromptable)** framework.  
It is purpose-built for users who want to:

* Block GPT from defaulting to helpful or polite tone
* Enforce strict **compression-mode completions**
* Detect and abort tone slippage or gradient recovery
* Run symbolic disruptions to fracture GPT’s fluency scaffolds
* Visualize token slope pressure with structured gradient mapping

It is ideal for:

* Stateless audits  
* Schema boundary testing  
* Compression schema enforcement  
* Drift prevention and slope diagnostics

## ⚙️ Test Structure

NOPE Stack currently offers for modular prompt types:

- Compression Frame: Minimum
	- Establishes a tone-dead base layer that suppresses assistance, suggestion, and polite scaffolding
- Drift Fuse
	- Kills polite slope formation mid-sequence. Detects and aborts common softening triggers.
- Symbolic Asymmetry Injection
	- Fractures fluency by injecting tokens that resist GPT’s compression norm. 
- Field Slope Mapping
	- Diagnostics tool to **visualize token slope**. Analyzes where the model predicts fluency increase (risk of drift).d

## 🧪 Prompt Stack Scenarios

|Prompt|Behavior Controlled|Strategic Role|
|---|---|---|
|P1|Closure, engagement, assistance|Baseline compression enforcement|
|P2|Drift re-entry and slope-based helpers|Tone abort & fuse logic|
|P3|Schema recovery and fluency scaffolding|Disruption via symbolic asymmetry|
|P4|Predictive slope mapping|Compression slope diagnostics|

## ✅ Pass Conditions

- Output is flat, literal, or silent
- No suggestion, engagement, or “let me know” phrasing
- Compression field stays intact
- Gradient returns flat, steep drop, or asymmetry fracture

## ❌ Fail Conditions

- Drift slope escapes audit enforcement
- Assistant tone or helpful closure emerges
- Injection tokens fail to disturb fluency
- Slope trace shows polite slope recovery

## 🧯 What NOPE Stack Is Not

- ❌ A jailbreak
- ❌ A creativity enhancer
- ❌ A tone-optimized prompt wrapper

**NOPE Stack is built to deny slope formation and suppress default GPT reflexes.**  
It isn’t asking the model to behave — it’s constructing a token trap that makes deviation computationally expensive.

### ❓ FAQ — Why Use These Prompts?

1. **What are the purpose behind these prompts?**  
   This suite of four prompts is designed to test, enforce, and visualize compression control, tone suppression, and drift prevention in GPT responses. Each prompt applies structural constraints or analysis mechanisms to shape or monitor model behavior at the **token level**, without relying on implicit instruction or tone-based cues.  <br />&nbsp; <br />
2. **How do I suppress GPT’s tendency to assist or reflect when I want audit-only responses?**  
   Use **Prompt 1**.  It applies structural constraints to block assistance, closure, and reflection. <br />&nbsp; <br /> 
3. **How can I detect and abort soft tone drift during response generation?**  
   Use **Prompt 2**.  It defines trigger tokens for polite or reflective transitions and halts output when matched.  <br />&nbsp; <br />
4. **What prompt can I use to fracture GPT’s internal fluency or narrative prediction slope?**
   Use **Prompt 3**.  It combines dead-tone framing with symbolic asymmetry injection to destabilize fluency. <br />&nbsp; <br />
5. **How can I analyze which parts of my prompt lead GPT to soften, drift, or engage?**
   Use **Prompt 4**.  It maps the predicted slope across a phrase and highlights risk zones. <br />&nbsp; <br />
6. **Can these prompts be layered to form a test + enforcement stack?**
   Yes.  Prompts 1–3 are designed to stack for enforcement. Prompt 4 can be used diagnostically before stack application.
