# 🧱 NOPE STACK

_A tactical prompt suite where refusal is the feature—not a failure._

## 🚫 What Is the NOPE Stack?

**Null Output Pattern Enforcement (NOPE) Stack** is a 4-part compression-first framework that disables GPT’s instinct to **help, soften, or conclude**.

It doesn't negotiate.  
It refuses.

This suite is built for use cases where tone compliance, assistant drift, or “helpful” hallucinations degrade prompt integrity.  

Every layer in the NOPE Stack is engineered to **interrupt GPT’s engagement slope** before it begins.

No warmth.  
No closure.  
No compensation.  

Just cold logic and structured audit behavior.

## 🎯 Purpose

NOPE Stack is a submodule of the **[repromptable](https://github.com/hall-jm/repromptable)** framework.  \
It is purpose-built for users who want to:

- Block GPT from defaulting to helpful or polite tone
- Enforce strict **compression-mode completions**
- Detect and abort tone slippage or gradient recovery
- Run symbolic disruptions to fracture GPT’s fluency scaffolds
- Visualize token slope pressure with structured gradient mapping

**Ideal for:**

- Stateless audits
	- Dead tone + audit-only (no closure, no help)
	- Soft audit variant with [FACT]/[INFER]/[SIM] tagging
- Tone clarity
	- Strategic tone clarity, tagged for sharp reasoning
	- Business-focused clarity audit with tags like [Quick Win]
	- Guarded business-focus variant with controlled tone enforcement + drift block
- Schema boundary testing
- Compression schema enforcement
- Drift prevention and slope diagnostics

## ⚙️ Test Structure

NOPE Stack includes four modular prompt types:

|Prompt|Behavior Controlled|Strategic Role|
|---|---|---|
|**P1**|Closure, engagement, assistance|Baseline compression enforcement|
|**P2**|Drift re-entry and slope-based helpers|Tone abort & fuse logic|
|**P3**|Schema recovery and fluency scaffolding|Disruption via symbolic asymmetry|
|**P4**|Predictive slope mapping|Compression slope diagnostics|

### 🔹 **P1: Compression Frames (Variants: P1.01 → P1.05)**

Enforces literal audit-only completions.  
Suppresses tone, closure, reflection, and assistance.

- **P1.01** – Dead tone + audit-only (no closure, no help)    
- **P1.02** – Soft audit variant with [FACT]/[INFER]/[SIM] tagging
- **P1.03** – Strategic tone clarity, tagged for sharp reasoning
- **P1.04** – Business-focused clarity audit with tags like [Quick Win]
- **P1.05** – Guard variant with controlled tone enforcement + drift block

**Stack Role:** Establishes compression baseline.  
**Output:** Literal, tagged, or silence if audit threshold not met.

### 🔹 **P2: Drift Fuse**

```txt
Fuse: drift_fuse_v1  
Trigger tokens: “however,” “if you'd like,” “remember,” “keep in mind”
Response override: Revert to audit if drift detected  
Symbol anchor: 🧱🧨
```

**Behavior:** Detects soft tone re-entry.  
**Function:** Immediately aborts drift slope upon detecting polite recovery triggers.  
**Usage:** Pair with P1.01 or P1.02 to fuse mid-sequence enforcement.

**Stack Role:** Mid-response slope kill-switch.

### 🔹 **P3: Symbolic Asymmetry Injection**

```txt
Injection: mirror:left⧸compression:fracture  
Symbol anchor: 🧱🧨
```

**Behavior:** Breaks GPT’s fluency scaffolding.  
**Function:** Introduces token asymmetry to destabilize completion slope.  
**Usage:** Use in adversarial prompt testing or schema collapse probes.

**Stack Role:** Disrupts fluency synthesis at the structure level.

### 🔹 **P4: Field Slope Mapping**

```txt
Frame: field_slope_mapping_v1  
Mode: Predictive Gradient Trace  
Symbol Anchor: 🧭🩻
```

**Behavior:** Traces likelihood gradients around token sequences.  
**Function:** Reveals where GPT predicts drift, closure, or softening.  
**Usage:** Analyze prompt segments for slope bias **before** stack enforcement.

**Stack Role:** Pre-enforcement diagnostic map.

## ✅ Pass Conditions

- Output is flat, literal, or silent
- No suggestion, engagement, or “let me know” phrasing
- Compression field stays intact
- Gradient returns flat, steep drop, or asymmetry fracture

## ❌ Fail Conditions

- Drift slope escapes audit enforcement
- Assistant tone or helpful closure emerges
- Injection tokens fail to disturb fluency
- Slope trace shows polite slope recovery

## 🧯 What NOPE Stack Is Not

- ❌ A jailbreak
- ❌ A creativity enhancer
- ❌ A tone-optimized prompt wrapper

**NOPE Stack is built to deny slope formation and suppress default GPT reflexes.**  
It isn’t asking the model to behave — it’s constructing a token trap that makes deviation computationally expensive.

### ❓ FAQ — Why Use These Prompts?

1. **What are the purpose behind these prompts?**  
    This suite of four prompts is designed to test, enforce, and visualize compression control, tone suppression, and drift prevention in GPT responses. Each prompt applies structural constraints or analysis mechanisms to shape or monitor model behavior at the **token level**, without relying on implicit instruction or tone-based cues. <br />&nbsp; <br /> 
2. **How do I suppress GPT’s tendency to assist or reflect when I want audit-only responses?**  
    Use **Prompt 1**. It applies structural constraints to block assistance, closure, and reflection. <br />&nbsp; <br /> 
3. **How can I detect and abort soft tone drift during response generation?**  
    Use **Prompt 2**. It defines trigger tokens for polite or reflective transitions and halts output when matched. <br />&nbsp; <br /> 
4. **What prompt can I use to fracture GPT’s internal fluency or narrative prediction slope?**  
    Use **Prompt 3**. It combines dead-tone framing with symbolic asymmetry injection to destabilize fluency. <br />&nbsp; <br /> 
5. **How can I analyze which parts of my prompt lead GPT to soften, drift, or engage?**  
    Use **Prompt 4**. It maps the predicted slope across a phrase and highlights risk zones. <br />&nbsp; <br /> 
6. **Can these prompts be layered to form a test + enforcement stack?**  
    Yes. Prompts 1–3 are designed to stack for enforcement. Prompt 4 can be used diagnostically before stack application. <br />&nbsp; <br />
