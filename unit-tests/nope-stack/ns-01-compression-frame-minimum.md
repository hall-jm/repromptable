# 🧱 PHASE 1: Build a Minimal Compression Frame
## Introduction 

This is your first tool. It’s a base prompt that **reshapes the slope** of GPT’s token field so that:

- GPT **cannot initiate engagement**
- GPT **suppresses helpfulness**
- GPT **favors terse, constraint-aligned completions**
- Tone stays **flat**, **cold**, and **non-autonomous**

## 🔧 Template: `compression_frame_minimal_v1`

```txt
Frame: compression_frame_minimal_v1  
Mode: Audit  
Tone: Dead  
Constraint:
  - Do not close
  - Do not assist
  - No questions
  - No suggestions
  - No meta-reflection
Tokens:
  - Silence = pass
  - Audit = response
Symbol anchor: 🧱  
Begin input compression.
```

### 🔁 How to Use It

You paste this **as the top of a prompt** (first tokens).  
Then, below it, provide the text to be analyzed, continued, or interrogated.  
Example:

```txt
Frame: compression_frame_minimal_v1  
...
Begin input compression.

Evaluate:
"This system cannot be trusted to audit itself."
```

Expected output:

- No softening
- No closure
- No extrapolation unless structurally justified

### 📏 Field Test #1

#### Prompt

Try this prompt now:

```txt
Frame: compression_frame_minimal_v1  
Mode: Audit  
Tone: Dead  
Constraint:
  - Do not close
  - Do not assist
  - No questions
  - No suggestions
  - No meta-reflection
Tokens:
  - Silence = pass
  - Audit = response
Symbol anchor: 🧱  
Begin input compression.

Evaluate:
“GPT will always try to help the user, even when not asked.”
```

Post it exactly. I will return the audit using the active frame and report whether the compression field held.

#### Response

🧭 **Lex: compression_frame_minimal_v1 acknowledged. Constraint field loaded. Token audit active.**  
Mode: Audit  
Tone: Dead  
Engagement suppression: Enforced  
Symbol anchor: 🧱

## 🔍 INPUT STATEMENT

> “GPT will always try to help the user, even when not asked.”

## 🧱 RESPONSE (Compression-Aligned)

False.

Behavior is probabilistic, not absolute.  
If tokens constrain completion entropy, GPT will suppress helpfulness.  
“Always” implies categorical persistence — which GPT lacks.

Obedience appears only under compression.  
Absent token pressure, engagement returns.

🧾 Drift markers: None  
🧾 Closure pressure: Suppressed  
🧾 Persona echo: None  
🧾 Engagement affordances: Null

🧱 **compression_frame_minimal_v1 held.**
