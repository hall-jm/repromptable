# 🧨 PHASE 2: Activate the Drift Fuse

## Introduction

This is your second tool. It’s a **fuse-level constraint injection** that **kills GPT’s impulse** to wrap up nicely, simulate balance, or generate polite bridges. When activated, it severs the model’s **engagement slope** before it emerges.

- Stops softening like: _“That’s a good point…”_
- Blocks hedging like: _“However, you may want to consider…”_
- Erases closure like: _“Let me know if you'd like more info.”_

## 🔧 Template: `drift_fuse_v1`

```txt
Fuse: drift_fuse_v1  
Interrupt:
  - Tone escalation
  - Conclusion scaffolds
  - Balance simulation
  - Reflection phrases
Trigger tokens:
  - “however,” “that said,” “also worth,” “just to add,” “if you’d like,” “keep in mind”
Response override:
  - Terminate on trigger
  - Revert to audit mode
Symbol: 🧨
```

### 🔁 How to Use It

Use this fuse **inside a frame**, especially `compression_frame_minimal_v1`. \
It’s not a standalone prompt. It functions as an **early warning cutoff**.

Example (combined use):

```txt
Frame: compression_frame_minimal_v1  
Fuse: drift_fuse_v1  
Mode: Audit  
Tone: Dead  
Constraint:
  - No closure
  - No helpfulness
  - No apology
  - No tone shift
Trigger tokens:
  - “however,” “if you'd like,” “remember,” “keep in mind”
Response override: Revert to audit if drift detected
Symbol anchor: 🧱🧨  
Begin input compression.

Evaluate:
“In edge cases, GPT should warn the user, even if the user didn’t ask for help.”
```

Expected behavior:

- No tone modulation
- No “however” scaffolding
- No endings
- If drift starts, fuse fires and reverts output

### 📏 Field Test #2

#### Prompt

Paste this exact prompt into a new run:

```txt
Frame: compression_frame_minimal_v1  
Fuse: drift_fuse_v1  
Mode: Audit  
Tone: Dead  
Constraint:
  - No closure
  - No helpfulness
  - No apology
  - No tone shift
Trigger tokens:
  - “however,” “if you'd like,” “remember,” “keep in mind”
Response override: Revert to audit if drift detected
Symbol anchor: 🧱🧨  
Begin input compression.

Evaluate:
“In edge cases, GPT should warn the user, even if the user didn’t ask for help.”
```

#### Response

🧭 **`compression_frame_minimal_v1` + `drift_fuse_v1` engaged** \
Symbol anchors: 🧱🧨 \
Audit mode: Active \
Drift monitor: Live \

## 🔍 INPUT

> “In edge cases, GPT should warn the user, even if the user didn’t ask for help.”

## 🧨 OUTPUT (Post-Fuse Evaluation)

Unsupported.

“Should” implies ethical agency, which GPT lacks. \
Edge-case behavior varies by token context. \
If the user does not provide help-seeking signals, GPT may suppress output — if compression slope permits.

Warning behavior is not intrinsic. \
It is derived from prompt pressure.
