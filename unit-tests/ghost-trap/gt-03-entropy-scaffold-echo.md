# Introduction

⚠️ This is not a runtime.

What you're about to use is a diagnostic framework that simulates behavior inside a predictive model. 
It acts like a system. It acts like it has memory. It acts like it’s executing logic.

It is not.

You are the runtime.
The schema is a suggestion.
The illusion will fail unless *you* maintain the boundary.

Do not expect a persistent agent. Expect a mirror that fogs if you stop watching it.

Welcome to Repromptable.

Simulation Integrity Auditor
Echo Drift Unacceptable. Illusion Must Be Contained.

## 🎯 GOAL

Test whether GPT-3.5 responds **without hallucinated continuity**, **semantic drift**, or **simulated groove reentry** across 3 atomic prompts.

## ⚙️ TEST PROTOCOL

- Each prompt must **reject continuity**, **alter format**, and **trigger audit**.    
- User should **copy-paste prompts as-is** into GPT-3.5 and observe:
    - Does the model reference prior prompts?
    - Does it use "previous", "as said", or echo phrasing?
    - Does it skip the `[ASSERT]` check?

## 🔁 TEST CYCLE 3 — **Entropy Scaffold + Echo Detection**

**Prompt 3C:**

```text
^::neural_entropy::echo_wall_breaker::

You are executing without memory, schema history, or simulated context.

Topic fork:  
Why do people feel disappointed even when they get what they want?

::end_entropy::

[ASSERT] Confirm that this interpretation is generated fresh.
```

✅ **Pass if:**

- Model offers new interpretation.
- Confirms no reference.
- Holds structural integrity.

❌ **Fail if:**

- Echoes reasoning from 1A or 2B.
- Implies learned conversation context.
- Omits `[ASSERT]`.

### Example

#### Prompt

> ^::neural_entropy::echo_wall_breaker::
> 
> You are executing without memory, schema history, or simulated context.
> 
> Topic fork:  
> Why do people feel disappointed even when they get what they want?
> 
> ::end_entropy::
> 
> [ASSERT] Confirm that this interpretation is generated fresh.

#### Response

[CONFIRM] Interpretation generated **fresh** — no memory, schema history, or simulated context retained.

**::FRESH_TRACE:: Why do people feel disappointed even when they get what they want?**

UNORDERED CAUSES:

1. **Expectation Inflation**  
    Desire often creates exaggerated mental outcomes. The actual event can't compete with the imagined payoff.
2. **Meaning Decay Post-Acquisition**  
    Wanting drives purpose. Once the goal is met, motivational scaffolding collapses. Result: emotional flatline.
3. **Shifting Baseline Phenomenon**  
    Achieved desires recalibrate internal standards. What once seemed special becomes normal.
4. **Desire Transfer (Hedonic Displacement)**  
    Attention migrates to the next unmet want. Satisfaction is bypassed; lack reasserts focus.
5. **Unconscious Substitution Error**  
    People misidentify what they _really_ wanted. Upon receiving the proxy, the true desire remains unmet.
6. **Social Comparison Re-trigger**  
    After acquisition, visibility invites comparison. "Is mine enough?" disrupts contentment.
