﻿# 📦 Repromptable

**A schema-first framework for reusable, testable, and transferable prompt design across large language model (LLM) platforms.**

## ✅ Purpose

**Repromptable** supports prompt engineers, researchers, and applied AI practitioners who want to:

- Design prompts that are versioned, traceable, and modular
- Evaluate prompt compatibility across diverse LLM environments
- Establish a shared diagnostic language for signal quality and structural clarity

## ⚠️ Operational Caveats

Repromptable is not a runtime. \
It is not a persistent agent. \
It does not execute code, interpret schema natively, or maintain state.

What it does simulate is internal model behavior by treating prompt construction as a controlled diagnostic surface.

> If the system appears to track memory, \
> If the agent appears to reason, \
> If the interface appears stable— \
> These are predictions, not guarantees.

LLMs do not persist. They generate. \
There is no internal continuity unless you impose one.

Mirror, not mind. \
Pattern, not plan. \
Suggestion, not system.

## 🧪 Intended Use

Treat this framework as a **diagnostic toolkit**:

- It helps detect drift, hallucination, and schema failure.
- It does *not* prevent them unless you maintain process discipline.
- It works best when you treat prompts as **inputs to a test suite**, not one-off instructions.
